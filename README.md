As a part of Retails Sales Data Analysis I have performed analysis using two ways:
1) Data Analysis and Visualization using PowerBI Dashboard/Report
2) Data Analysis and Visualization using Python

# 2. Visualization on Retail Sales using Python

**Problem Statement:**
Develop a data analysis and predictive model for a retail business. The business wants to optimize its operations by analyzing sales, inventory managment and marketing efforts. The dataset provided includes detailed sales records, customer demographics, product details, and marketing data.

**Goal is to:**
  •	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the data.
  •	Develop machine learning models to predict future sales based on historical data.
  •	Analyze the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
  •	Provide insights for optimizing inventory management.
  •	Create visualizations that communicate key findings to stakeholders.
______________

**Data Understanding and Cleaning:**
1.	What are the data types of each column in the dataset?
2.	Are there any missing values in the dataset? How can you handle them?
3.	What is the distribution of sales revenue across different products?
4.	What percentage of total records contain missing data?
5.	Are there any outliers in the sales or marketing spend columns? How do you detect them?
6.	How can you deal with outliers in the dataset?
7.	What are the unique values for categorical columns like 'Product Category' and 'Store Location'?
8.	Is there any duplicated data in the dataset?
9.	What is the range of dates in the dataset, and how many records belong to each year?
10.	How can you standardize or normalize numerical columns such as sales revenue and units sold?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

11.	What are the top 10 products by total sales revenue?

12.	Which stores have the highest average sales revenue?

13.	What is the trend of total sales across the months and years?

14.	How does marketing spend impact the sales revenue?

15.	Which day of the week has the highest sales on average?

16.	What are the most popular product categories in terms of units sold?

17.	What is the average discount percentage applied to products?

18.	What are the busiest times of the year for sales (e.g., holiday seasons)?

19.	How does sales performance vary by store location?

20.	How does the holiday effect impact sales compared to regular days?
